# AnimeMaou

A single page web-app to view top monthly anime's or a list of recent releases of anime's.

I used React as the backbone of this web-app and SCSS preprocessor for styling.

For the data on anime-list I used Jikan api which is a great fast and easy to use api by MyAnimeList.

This project is intended

## Demo:

Thank you for your time.
